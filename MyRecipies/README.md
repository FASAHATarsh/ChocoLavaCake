# **<u>MOLTEN CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE</u>**



### ***Molten chocolate cake is a popular dessert that combines the elements of a flourless chocolate cake and a souffl√©. Its name derives from the dessert's liquid chocolate center, and it is also known as chocolate moelleux (from French for "soft"), chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake. The United States-based chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten claims tohave invented molten chocolate cake in New York City in 1987, but the French chef and chocolatier Jacques Torres disputes this, arguing that such a dish already existed in France.***
